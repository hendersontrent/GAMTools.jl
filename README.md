# GAMTools

Fit, evaluate, and visualise generalised additive models (GAMs) in native Julia

## Purpose

`GAMTools.jl` is a lightweight Julia package for analysing, interpreting, and visualising [generalised additive models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model) (GAMs) fit in Julia using [`GAM.jl`](https://github.com/hendersontrent/GAM.jl)

## Development notes

`GAMTools.jl` is very much a work in progress. Please check back for updates and new features or feel free to contribute yourself!

### Future pipeline

The future pipeline of functionality includes:

* Plots for non-smooth covariates
* Visual residual diagnostics
* Model fit calculations
* Prediction visualisations
