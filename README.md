# GAMTools

Plotting and utility functions for the interpretation of GAMs in Julia

## Purpose

`GAMTools.jl` is a lightweight Julia package for analysing, interpreting, and visualising [generalised additive models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_additive_model) (GAMs) fit in Julia using [`GAM.jl`](https://github.com/hendersontrent/GAM.jl)

## Development notes

**IMPORTANT:** `GAMTools.jl` is currently not functional until the next iteration of `GAM.jl` is complete. Please check back soon!

### Future pipeline

The future pipeline of functionality includes:

* Plots for non-smooth covariates
* Visual residual diagnostics
* Model fit calculations
* Prediction visualisations
